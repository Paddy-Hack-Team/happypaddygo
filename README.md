- ### Design

  - #### General

    - This webpage was created as a mobile first, giving the appearence of an app with cards containing the content. If opened in devices with larger screen, the cards are going to be resized and be shown in 2 columns, this make the site easier to mantain if necessary to include or remove cards.

    - The Marck Script is the main font used throughout the whole website with Roboto in the Menu items, footer and paragraphs. To keep this site consitent Open Sans is used as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

  - #### Imagery

    - Imagery is very important and we used that throughout our site to present a visually appeal webiste.
    - Videos are used for the same reason to enhance the user experience.
